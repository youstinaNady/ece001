          Artificial intelligence is the capability of a digital computer or robot controlled by computer to do tasks which is related with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project to make systems for granted human mental operations in progress, such as the skill to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from previous experience. Since the advancement in the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been established that computers could be programmed to perform very complex tasks, for example, determining proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great efficiency . Despite continuing advances in the process of computer's speed and the capacity of memory, there are no programs that can match human resilience across broader areas or in tasks that require a lot of daily knowledge .On the other hand, some programs have achieved the levels of performance of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.
          There is some challenges of artificial intelligence which are:
           -Artificial intelligence is going to change every industry, but we have to understand its limits.
          
          - The main limitation of artificial intelligence is that it learns from data. There is no other way in which knowledge can be combined. This means that any inaccuracies in 
          the data will be reflected in the results. Any additional layers for forecasting or analysis should be added separately.
          - Artificial intelligence systems are trained today for a clearly defined mission. The system that plays poker cannot play solitaire or chess. The system that detects fraud 
          cannot drive or provide legal advice to you. Indeed, the AI system that detects health care fraud cannot detect tax fraud or warranty claims accurately.
          In other words, these systems are very specialized. They can focus on one task and are away from behaving like humans.
          Likewise, self-learning systems are not independent systems. The imagined AI techniques you see in movies and TV are still science fiction. But computers that can scan complex data for learning and perfect specific tasks are becoming very popular

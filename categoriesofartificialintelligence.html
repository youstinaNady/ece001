        <td>this category represents Strong artificial intelligence this type we can see in the movies,such as the robots from West world or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation.It is much similar to human being,and reach to the level of its intelligence so it can apply this intelligence to resolve any problem</td> 
        <td> this category represents weak AI that can be done in limited context and it is a imitation of human intelligence. it is often focused on performing one task very well and although these machines may appear smart, they operate with much more limitations and constraints than even basic human intelligence.it is easily more successful awareness of artificial intelligence to date. Narrow Artificial intelligence has qualified many forward steps in knowledge  in the recent decade , Obama Administration released a report at 2016 that  "significant societal benefits and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation," according to "Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence,".

            There are some examples of  narrow artificial intelligence :
            <ul>
            <li>Google search </li>
           <li>Image recognition software</li> 
            <li>Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants</li>
            <li>Self-driving cars</li>
            <li>IBM's Watson</li>
            <li>video games like the chess</li>
